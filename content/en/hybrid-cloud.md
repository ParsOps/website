## Hybrid Cloud Solutions — Best of Both Worlds

Hybrid cloud combines the flexibility and scalability of public cloud with the control and security of private infrastructure. At ParsOps, we design and implement hybrid cloud solutions that give you the optimal balance of performance, security, cost, and compliance.

### What is Hybrid Cloud?

Hybrid cloud is an IT infrastructure that combines public cloud services, private cloud (or on-premises infrastructure), and orchestration between them. This approach allows data and applications to move between private and public clouds, giving businesses greater flexibility and more deployment options.

### Why Hybrid Cloud?

**Flexibility**  
Run workloads where they make the most sense — some on-premises, some in the cloud.

**Cost Optimization**  
Leverage cloud for variable workloads while maintaining on-premises infrastructure for steady-state operations.

**Data Sovereignty & Compliance**  
Keep sensitive data on-premises while using cloud for less sensitive workloads.

**Gradual Cloud Migration**  
Move to the cloud at your own pace without disrupting operations.

**Disaster Recovery**  
Use cloud as a backup and DR site for on-premises infrastructure.

**Performance**  
Run latency-sensitive applications on-premises while using cloud for batch processing.

**Avoid Vendor Lock-in**  
Maintain independence by not relying solely on a single cloud provider.

### Hybrid Cloud Use Cases

**Burst to Cloud**  
Handle traffic spikes by bursting to public cloud when on-premises capacity is exceeded.

**Data Processing**  
Keep data on-premises for compliance while using cloud compute for processing.

**Development & Testing**  
Use cloud for dev/test environments while running production on-premises.

**Legacy Application Support**  
Maintain legacy systems on-premises while building new applications in the cloud.

**Multi-Region Presence**  
Combine on-premises datacenters with cloud regions for global reach.

**Disaster Recovery**  
Replicate on-premises systems to cloud for business continuity.

### Hybrid Cloud Architecture Patterns

**Cloud Bursting**  
Automatically scale to cloud when on-premises capacity is reached.

**Data Tiering**  
Keep hot data on-premises, archive cold data to cloud storage.

**Active-Passive DR**  
Run production on-premises with cloud as standby disaster recovery site.

**Active-Active**  
Run workloads simultaneously on-premises and in cloud for redundancy.

**Data Processing**  
Store data on-premises, process in cloud, return results.

**Distributed Applications**  
Run different components in optimal locations (e.g., database on-premises, web tier in cloud).

### Connectivity Options

**VPN (Virtual Private Network)**  
Secure, encrypted tunnel over the internet. Cost-effective for moderate bandwidth needs.

**Direct Connect / ExpressRoute**  
Dedicated, private connection to cloud providers. Higher bandwidth, lower latency, more reliable.

**SD-WAN**  
Software-defined networking for intelligent routing and optimized connectivity.

**Hybrid WAN**  
Combine multiple connection types for redundancy and performance.

### Security & Compliance

- Data loss prevention (DLP)
- Secure data transfer mechanisms
- Key management

**Network Security**
- Firewall and segmentation
- Intrusion detection/prevention
- DDoS protection
- Security monitoring and SIEM
