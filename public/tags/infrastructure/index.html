    <h2><a href="/object-storage/">Object Storage</a></h2>
    Scalable Object Storage Solutions Object storage is a modern approach to storing unstructured data at scale. Unlike traditional file systems, object storage manages data as objects, making it ideal for cloud-native applications, backups, media files, and big data analytics.
What is Object Storage? Object storage is a data storage architecture that manages data as objects, rather than as files in a hierarchy or blocks on a storage device. Each object includes the data itself, metadata, and a unique identifier, making it highly scalable and easily accessible.
